# 2d-fire-mapmaker

Creates a map for the game 2d fire.

Working(kinda):<br>
Every tile is an image with an id.
The _layout_ uses the ids of the tiles to create a map.

Have to think of a way to have two sets of tiles at the same place so that a player can only see the inside of a building when the player is in it.<br>
Perhaps nested maps could work for that.
